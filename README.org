* Base Server
Is a personal test template for the *gonew* command from go toolchain,
with the major configurations i usually make on each project adding:
- env File
- Makefile
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose
- metrics endpoint
- and static file server
it's just a test*

**  Basic Usage
For starting using this template, is needed to have go installed in
the system with at leat 1.20 and make sure *gonew* is present
#+begin_src shell
  gonew github.com/maximotejeda/baseserver github.com/example/simpleserver
#+end_src
this command will create a new folder in the place where is called
with the path of ./simpleserver
#+begin_src shell
  cd ./simpleserver
#+end_src
after that the file structure of the project will be present on the folder.
